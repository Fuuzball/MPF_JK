-Write sampler for arbitrary HOLI (higher order local interaction) 
--Check understanding of SLMC, seems unecessary, why find J_eff, etc.? Do we start from the gibbs samples instead of anew?
V Impliment torch gibbs sampler
- Impliment torch SLMC
- Impliment MPF estimator with multiple interactions 
- Refactor MPF esitmators to not take X in initialization
