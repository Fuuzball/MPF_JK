VWrite sampler for arbitrary HOLI (higher order local interaction) 
--Check understanding of SLMC, seems unecessary, why find J_eff, etc.? Do we start from the gibbs samples instead of anew?
V Impliment torch gibbs sampler
- Impliment torch SLMC
V Impliment MPF estimator with multiple interactions 
V Refactor MPF esitmators to not take X in initialization
V Make hopfield object 
V- Get results for hopfield on random data
V Fix the inf error when fitting (aroudn D ~ 100)
- Fix convergence problem w/

- MPF NN interaction for random for different p
- check p vs 1 - p
- plot p vs capacity
- use third order
- OPR Mnist bias
- MNIST HO MPF

- Classification
- Generative model

- Theory
